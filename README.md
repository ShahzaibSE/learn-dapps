# Learn Dapps using Solidity and Javascript in Baby Steps

In this repo we will learn Solidity in baby steps. In each step we will first write JavaScript code and than write equivalent Solidity code. This way if you already know Javascript you will be able to compare and contrast the syntax. In case you do not know JavaScript it will help you in learning Solidity and Javascript at the same time.
